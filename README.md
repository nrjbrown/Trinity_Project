# Trinity_Project

Thank you for you for visiting SympSearch (Version 1.1). The purpose of this project is to enable U.S. based users to locate specialists for their medical conditions.

How to:

User input's their condition in the search bar
User clicks on search button to the right side.
The user is directed to the second page where a list of specialist's is populated.
In the lists page, the user will have access to the specialist's information ie. geographical location, phone numbers, profile information and profile picture.

This project will be updated accordingly.

Current bugs:

there is currently a bug in the search field as some conditions may not trigger a search response.
